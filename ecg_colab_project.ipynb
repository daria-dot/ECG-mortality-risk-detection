        "\n",
        "The problem is we can't just ask the model to predict \"yes/no\" for death. A patient who lived for 9 years and then died is very different from a patient who died in 9 days. We need to teach the model about the element of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, we are replicating the \"discrete-time survival\" method from the Lancet paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the process:\n",
        "\n",
        "We \"Discretize\" Time: Instead of viewing time as a single number (like 800 days), we chop the 10-year follow-up period into 120 small, equal \"intervals\" (like 120 months).\n",
        "\n",
        "We Create y_true (The \"Label\" Array): We create a \"scorecard\" for every single patient that is 120 slots long. Each slot j in the scorecard represents a time interval (e.g., month j).\n",
        "\n",
        "We put a 1 in a slot if the patient survived that interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "We put a 0 in a slot if the patient died in that interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a patient who died in the 10th interval would have a y_true array that looks like: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...]\n",
        "\n",
        "We Create y_mask (The \"Mask\" Array): This is just as important. We need to tell the model which parts of the scorecard to pay attention to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many patients in the dataset didn't die; they were just \"lost to follow-up\" after a certain time (e.g., 5 years). We know they survived for 5 years, but we have no idea what happened in year 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "The y_mask array tells the model which slots are \"valid.\" We put a 1 in a slot if we have data for that interval and a 0 if we don't.\n",
        "\n",
        "This mask ensures the model only learns from the data we actually have and isn't punished for \"wrong\" guesses on intervals where we have no information.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary: Phase 3 converts two simple columns (death and timey) into two detailed arrays (y_true and y_mask) that will teach our model to predict the probability of survival for each month over a 10-year period."
